## Problem
We are presenting an idea of a web digital Auction which will help its users to facilitate auctions online.

## Proposed Solution
Setup Auction by category with slots i.e by specifying a start and end time. Dynamic bidding to each sale auction item. Realtime updates while placing bids. Dynamic closing of bid.

## Features
* Signup and Signin for user management
* User Profile Details
* Forgot Password
* View all Auctions & Place Bid
* Create new Auction by assigning a specific slot time when auction begins
* Set base bidding amount
* Set bid increment amount 
* Real time updates for Biddings place by various users


## Future Enhancements
1. Payment Integration - User would be able to pay the placed bid and other charges via online payment channel
2. White-labeling - setting it up for different companies/organisations
